### Overview: Include overview here

    The application is a project idea documentation... application that allows the user to draw out ideas on individual canvases, while also
        allowing them to pin reference photos on the side and keep notes in a notepad. Each canvas/reference photos/nodepad collection
        is saved separately in a larger grid system, allowing for organization. It's meant to be a convenient way for users to keep
        all of their ideas for any prospective craft (or otherwise) project in one spot for easy visual reference. Pinterest but a tool.

### Features: Include Features here
Interactive Canvases
    -The main function of the website is individual, "self-contained" Interactive Canvases on which
        the user can sketch ideas for projects. The Interactive Canvases are "self-contained" in each
        thumbnail of the Visual Grid Homepage Thing. The Interactive Canvas will have basic drawing/erasing
        functionality, with brush size control and brush color options.

Visual Grid Homepage
    -The homepage will be made up of a (3 x ∞) grid which contains cards made up of individual instances 
        of Interactive Canvases. Each card will display a thumbnail of its respective Interactive Canvas drawing.
        Clicking on one of the cards will open its respective Interactive Canvas, allowing the user to continue
        working on it. Emphasis on the Interactive Canvas thumbnails being large and visually distinct.
 
User Login
    -Users will be able to log in to save their individual Interactive Canvases within their Visual Grid Homepage. 

Reference Image Board: Extended functionality
    -The user will get a side board to hold reference project photos. This will be secondary to the main drawing canvas.
        The reference photos will occupy a (1 x ∞) vertical collapsable bar on the side of the screen (left).

Text Reference Board
    -The user will get a text field side board to take notes/hold relevant links/etc. This will be secondary to the 
        main drawing canvas. The text field will occupy a vertical collapsable bar on the opposing side of the screen (right).

### What I'll Have to Learn: Include what you will need to learn here
    The first problem I'm forseeing is saving the user's work in the canvases. Saving data like that seems tricky. 
        I also have to learn how to add the canvases in the first place. (LiterallyCanvas API?). Most of the other 
        learning that I'll have to do will be brushing up on my database skills.
